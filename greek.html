        <p>I’ve always been a fan of Greek mythology and I was pleasantly surprised to discover 
            <br>that there is a lot of amazing origami that’s right<br>
            <br>out of Greek myths and stories.
            <br> The basilisk is called the King of Serpents and is said to be able to kill you 
            <br> just with one look. Other stories say that it’s so poisonous
        <br>that it leaves a trail of venom in its wake</p>
        
        <br>
            
            <p>Fortunately look at or folding this excellent origami Basilisk won’t horribly poison or kill you.<br> </p>
